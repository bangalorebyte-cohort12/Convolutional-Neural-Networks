Resources

1) Go through these videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z91YCMvxdo0&list=PLBAGcD3siRDjBU8sKRk0zX9pMz9qeVxud . Only need to go from 1-13 (Classic Networks)

2) Read the Computer Vision Chapter in Deep learning in Python. Try and follow along with the code in that chapter. On Monday I will go through this concept and the code again.
